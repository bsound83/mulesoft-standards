# MuleSoft API Design and Development Standards

MuleSoft has a great ecosystem to create and manage APIs.

We must take a methodical approach when designing, developing and managing APIs. MuleSoft provides the Anypoint Platform to assist in the design and management and with utilization of Anypoint Studio, we can take it a step further by taking our designing and developing based off of the designs. 

## Design and Development Integration
Anypoint Studio's integration with the Anypoint Api Managmenet (AAM) increases our speed to delivery by providing a skeleton to the MuleSoft application from our RAML file, the output of our API design. 

## RAML
RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) is the langauge with which MuleSoft is supporting to Design, Build, Test, Document and Share. There are currently two versions of the language, RAML 0.8 and RAML 1.0. You can find more information at [raml.org](http://raml.org/).
